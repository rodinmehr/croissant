            A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of 
            the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical 
            crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, 
            then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, 
            flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
            The modern croissant seems to have been created by the French chef Sylvain Claudius Goy.
